# Shared-bicycle-management-in-IPL
This was my first project in C language and my first contact to a programming language that i made during my first semester in Computer Engineering Degree.  I am posting here my original code with all the mistakes i made.  Not much comments on the code, which i learned to do them, and the ones i made were in Portuguese.

This program was made to manage the bicycles used to travel from/to IPL campi.

It can manage users and bicycles as well as the loan registrys and the wait list for the biycles.
